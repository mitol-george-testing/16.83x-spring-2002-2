  "course_description": "Space Systems Engineering (16.83X) is the astronautical capstone course option in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\u00a0 Between Spring 2002 and Spring 2003, the course was offered in a 3-semester format, using a Conceive, Design, Implement and Operate (C-D-I-O) teaching model.\u00a016.83X is shorthand for the three course numbers: 16.83, 16.831, and 16.832.\u00a0The first semester (16.83) is the Conceive-Design phase of the project, which results in a detailed system design, but precedes assembly.\u00a0 The second semester (16.831) is the Implement phase, and involves building the\u00a0students' system.\u00a0 The final semester (16.832) is the Operate phase, in which the system is\u00a0tested and readied to\u00a0perform in its intended environment.\n\nThis year's project objective was to demonstrate the feasibility of an electromagnetically controlled array of formation flying satellites.\u00a0 The project, \"EMFFORCE\", was\u00a0an extension of the first C-D-I-O course project, \"SPHERES\", which ran from\u00a0Spring 1999 through Spring 2000, and demonstrated satellite formation flying using gas thrusters for station-keeping.\u00a0 The whole class works on the same project,\u00a0but divides\u00a0into smaller subsystem teams, such as\u00a0power, metrology, and structures, to handle design details.\n",
