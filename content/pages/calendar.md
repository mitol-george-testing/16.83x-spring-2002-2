The calendar below includes the lecture (LE) and lab (LA) sessions for the first semester (16.83). The lectures provide background on the project, its technical knowledge requirements, and introduces students to aspects of system design which may be unfamiliar. Major presentations are identified in the Key Dates column, and sometimes include external audience members.

Subsequent semesters (16.831, 16.832) favor lab activities heavily.  Lectures are given on demand, when a knowledge gap is identified.  Milestones for each semester include major presentations and important report documents.
